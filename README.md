# Hello!

I'm an information technology student at HAMK, 
and a beginner developer.


:bulb: Iâ€™m currently learning C# and CISSP domains

:grey_question: One might describe me with words such as 
goal-directed, efficient, outgoing, teamplayer and curious.

:snowman: Fun fact: I've taken a swim in icy lake and diven into a pile of snow!
